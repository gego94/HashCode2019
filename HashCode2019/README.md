This is my code made with some friends for Google HashCode 2019.

We made following scores :

a_example : 2
b_lovely_lanscapes : 202938
c_memorable_moments : 1426
d_pet_pictures : 410752
e_shiny_selfies : 397965

total : 1_013_083

b,d and e inputs run in about 20 / 30  minutes.

Unfortunately we haven't run our code in time in the 4 hours given, but due to
some errors we lost time and make scores in the extended round.
Next improvement for our could would be matching vertical photos in a better way
(we were thinking about matching before the ones with less tags and then match
  them with best matches possible).
